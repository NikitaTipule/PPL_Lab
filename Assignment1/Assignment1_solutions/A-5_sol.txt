A-5 Static Single Assignment
-----------------------------


        1   Do you notice that each usage of local variable as an operand uses a
            suffix that can be tracked to it's assignment? Why do some variables
            have a suffix `(D)'?
   Ans :    Yes, I noticed that each usage of local variable as an operand uses a suffix .
   Some variables have a suffix '(D)' , may be it's because that variable is not defined.
   
   
        2   Find the point in the CFG in  which the paths of the two assignments
            to variable `a'  and `b' merge. You will notice  that PHI statements
            have  been  introduced.  Can  you   guess  the  syntax  of  the  PHI
            statements?
    Ans :   Syntax of the PHI = PHI <name_of_variable(the number of the basic block in which it was declared), name_of_variable(the number of the basic block in which it was declared),........ >  
    
    
        3   Can you think of an example in which a PHI node merges more than two
            versions of a variable?
   Ans :    This could come from if-else blocks.
