B-4 Common Subexpression Elimination
------------------------------------

        1   How many  times is the expression  (a + c) computed  in the original
            code (as seen in the SSA pass)? What about after the FRE pass?
  Ans :   Twice as seen in SSA pass and only once after the FRE pass.
  

       2   Have  there been  any more  optimizations  after FRE?  How will  you
            check?  
  Ans : 
  
        3   Why did  we have  to put a  "return b" in  this assignment?  What if
            "return b" is changed to "return 0"? Will it make any difference?
   Ans :    when we dont return b the it will beccome an dead code because it dont return anything means no output . when we change "return b" to "return 0" then same thing will happen here also.
