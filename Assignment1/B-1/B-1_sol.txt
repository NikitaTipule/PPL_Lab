B-1 Function Inlining
---------------------

        1   The body  of AddTwo(x)  seems to  be inlined into  the call  of main
            rendering the function useless (nobody else is calling it). Then why
            is the definition of AddTwo(x) still there all the way till the last
            pass (B-1.c.*.optimized)?
  Ans :    It can't be discarded. it may be called from another translation unit.
  

        2   Is there any way to get rid of it?
  Ans :    we can add static keyworld to the prototype to signify that its linkage is internal only.
