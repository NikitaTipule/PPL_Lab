A-2 Conditional Jumps and Control Flow Graphs
---------------------------------------------



        1   How have if-blocks  been translated into GIMPLE  statements? Can you
            differentiate between conditional and unconditional gotos?
  Ans :     While executing the if block the statements under the if block , it gives one code to          it and for else block it gives the other code. these codes are defined after this block and then it is executed.
         conditional branch is happened based on some condition like if condition in C. Transfer of control of the program will depend on the outcome of this condition.

Uncoonditional branching occurs without any condition like goto statement.



        2   Repeat  the  above compilation,  but  now  asking for  another  dump
            that  of  the pass  "cfg".  View  this  pass  and say  whether  this
            representation makes it easier to  read and understand GIMPLEs. Draw
            the control-flow graph  of the program A-2.c on a  piece of paper by
            looking at the CFG dump.
